# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day.

## Description

In this weeks challenege, I created a schedule where I colour coded each timeblock depending on the users current time, by sorting the hours into the past, present, and future. I then allowed for text to be entered into the block and saved it into the local storage.

## Installation

No steps required to install project.

## Usage

Depending on the current hour of the user, the color will be grey for hours in the past, red for the current hour, and green for future hours
